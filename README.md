# coup-server
coup-server is an implementation of the game, Coup, but as a server. Besides the actual game logic; the server aims to be featureful, to the point where it could be built by another company and no one would notice the difference.

So, things like:
- [ ] Oauth 2 implementation with several backends
- [ ] Docker image support
- [ ] A CLI for real time monitoring of games; logged in users and more.
- [ ] GraphQL route instead of REST 

must be implemented. This is my ticket to a software engineering job; after this I probably won't program open source projects for a really long time.

Hire me already.
